## General Information
- **Background**: The rise in shared bike services has created the need for accurate demand prediction models. This project uses historical data to predict the number of bike rentals on any given day.
- **Business Problem**: The goal is to optimize bike availability by predicting demand, thus reducing the chances of over- or under-supply, leading to better customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
- **Dataset**: The analysis is based on the `day.csv` dataset, which includes various factors such as weather conditions, seasonality, and holidays that may affect bike rental demand.

## Conclusions
- **Key Finding 1**: Temperature is the most significant predictor of bike rental demand, with higher temperatures leading to increased rentals.
- **Key Finding 2**: Weather conditions also play a crucial role, with clear weather leading to more bike rentals.
- **Key Finding 3**: The model's assumptions were validated through residual analysis, confirming its reliability.
- **Key Finding 4**: The final model effectively reduces multicollinearity, as indicated by acceptable VIF values.
